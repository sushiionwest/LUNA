## User Experience Validation

### 🎯 One-Click Install Experience

The integration successfully demonstrates our core user-centric design principle:

- **User clicks "Install Luna"** → Backend automatically provisions VM
- **Progress appears instantly** → Real-time feedback without technical jargon  
- **Installation completes** → User sees "Luna is ready!" message
- **All complexity hidden** → No mention of VMs, ports, or technical details

### 📊 Real-Time Monitoring

Testing infrastructure captures comprehensive data:

- Installation step timing and success rates
- User interaction patterns and pain points
- System performance and resource usage
- Error frequencies and resolution paths

## Next Steps for Production
