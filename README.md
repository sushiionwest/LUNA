# 🌙 Luna Visual AI - One-Click Computer Assistant

**The AI that sees your screen and clicks for you.**

Luna Visual AI is a portable, single-executable computer assistant that uses advanced computer vision to understand your screen and execute commands through natural language. Just double-click `luna.exe` and start telling it what to do!

## ✨ What Makes Luna Special

### 🎯 **Pure Visual Intelligence**
- **Sees Everything**: Uses advanced AI models (CLIP, Florence-2, TrOCR, SAM) to understand your screen like a human would
- **Adapts to Changes**: No brittle automation - Luna finds buttons even when they move or websites change design
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Processes your screen in real-time to find exactly what you're looking for

### 🚀 **One-Click Simplicity**
- **No Installation**: Just download `luna.exe` and double-click to run
- **No Dependencies**: Everything embedded in a single portable executable
- **No Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults

### 🔒 **Safety First**
- **Visual Preview**: Shows you exactly what it will click before doing anything
- **3-Second Countdown**: Always gives you time to cancel with ESC
- **Smart Blocking**: Automatically prevents dangerous operations
- **Emergency Stop**: Ctrl+Shift+Esc twice to stop everything immediately

## 🎮 How It Works

Luna follows a simple 6-step process:

```
1. 🎤 YOU SPEAK/TYPE → "Close all browser tabs"
2. 📸 LUNA CAPTURES → Takes screenshot of your screen  
3. 🤖 AI ANALYZES → Finds all clickable elements and text
4. 🎯 LUNA PLANS → Decides exactly where to click
5. ⏰ VISUAL PREVIEW → Shows highlights + 3-second countdown
6. 🖱️ LUNA CLICKS → Executes the actions perfectly
```
