# Luna Testing Framework
# Implements Strategic Recommendation #3: Testing Strategy

## Overview
Comprehensive testing strategy for Luna Agent installer and VM across multiple levels:
- Unit Testing: Individual component validation
- Integration Testing: Cross-component functionality
- End-to-End Testing: Complete user workflows
- User Acceptance Testing: Real user feedback
- Performance Testing: Resource usage and scalability
- Security Testing: Vulnerability assessment

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing
**Scope:** Individual functions and components
**Tools:** Jest (JavaScript), pytest (Python)
**Coverage:** 90%+ code coverage target

### 2. Integration Testing  
**Scope:** Component interactions, API endpoints
**Tools:** Supertest, Playwright
**Focus:** VM lifecycle, installer operations

### 3. End-to-End Testing
**Scope:** Complete user workflows
**Tools:** Playwright, Selenium
**Scenarios:** Full installation, Luna startup, automation tasks

### 4. User Acceptance Testing
**Scope:** Real user feedback and usability
**Tools:** Custom testing portal, analytics
**Metrics:** Installation success rate, user satisfaction

### 5. Performance Testing
**Scope:** Resource usage, response times
**Tools:** Artillery, k6, custom monitoring
**Targets:** <5min install, <30s Luna startup

## Test Environments
- **Local Development:** Unit and integration tests
- **Staging:** E2E and performance tests  
- **Production:** User acceptance and monitoring

## Automation
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Automated test execution on PR/merge
- Performance regression detection
- Security vulnerability scanning
